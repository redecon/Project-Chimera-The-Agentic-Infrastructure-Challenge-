# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

All plans MUST include a short Constitution Check that demonstrates compliance with the Project Chimera constitution. At minimum, the plan MUST assert and/or document the following gates:

- **Spec-First**: Reference the spec file in `/specs/` that authorizes this work (path and section).
- **Agent Architecture**: Confirm which Planner/Worker/Judge roles are involved and how task envelopes will be propagated.
- **Traceability**: Identify the artifact IDs, logging strategy, and where provenance will be recorded (e.g., DB table or metadata store).
- **Data Separation**: State where transactional data will be stored (PostgreSQL) and where semantic/embedding data will live (Vector DB). Explain any exceptions.
- **HITL / Judge Gate**: If the feature interacts with external systems (on-chain, publish APIs, payments), describe the Judge/HITL approval workflow.
- **Security & Secrets**: Confirm secret management strategy and any required access controls.
- **Testing & Observability**: List the required unit/contract/integration tests and observability hooks that will be added.

The plan author MUST include short affirmative statements for each gate (pass/warn/block) and link to any needed risk assessments or sign-offs.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
