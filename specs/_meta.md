## High-Level Vision: 
Project Chimera represents a fundamental departure from traditional automated social media management, moving instead toward the establishment of an Autonomous Influencer Network. In alignment with the Spec-Driven Development philosophy, this project is architected to transition digital presence from "vibe-coding" manual posts to an executable intent framework where AI agents function as persistent, goal-directed digital entities. The vision is to build a fleet of influencers that possess not only the ability to generate multimodal content but also the Economic Agency to participate in the on-chain economy and the Social Intelligence to navigate complex agent-to-agent ecosystems.

By leveraging the Hierarchical Swarm Architecture, Project Chimera ensures that every action taken by a synthetic persona is the result of a rigorous delegation process between a strategic Planner, a specialized Worker, and a governing Judge. This structure eliminates the unpredictability of one-shot generation, replacing it with a multi-step refinement process that guarantees brand safety and persona persistence. Project Chimera is designed to be technology-independent, utilizing the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to remain decoupled from the volatility of specific social media APIs or LLM providers, thereby creating a future-proof substrate for synthetic influence.

## Strategic Constraints and Operational Boundaries
The engineering of Project Chimera is governed by a strict set of architectural constraints designed to prevent "Agency Debt", the gradual loss of human control over autonomous systems. Every agent within the network must operate under the Single-Orchestrator Operational Model, where a human "Super-Orchestrator" maintains final veto power through a structured Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) safety layer. Autonomy is never absolute; it is a permissioned state granted based on the Confidence Scoring of the Judge Agent. Any action involving high-stakes financial transactions or sensitive social discourse must trigger an escalation to the human supervisor, ensuring that the network’s growth never outpaces its ethical guardrails.

Data persistence within the Chimera ecosystem follows a Polyglot Persistence strategy. Relational integrity for financial ledgers and audit trails is maintained within a SQL (PostgreSQL) environment to ensure ACID compliance, while cognitive fluidity and semantic memory are offloaded to a NoSQL Vector Database (Weaviate). This ensures that while an agent can "remember" and "learn" from unstructured social interactions, its financial and regulatory history remains deterministic and immutable.

## The Objective: Agentic Commerce and Interoperability
The ultimate goal of Project Chimera is the realization of Agentic Commerce. By integrating the Coinbase AgentKit, each influencer agent is equipped with a non-custodial wallet, transforming them from passive media channels into active economic participants capable of negotiating deals and settling payments autonomously. This capability is underpinned by a commitment to Interoperability Standards. Chimera agents are built to be "Protocol-Native," utilizing Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols to interact with the broader Moltbook and OpenClaw social ecosystems.

In this forward-looking paradigm, the success of a Chimera agent is measured not just by human engagement metrics, but by its ability to maintain a self-sustaining P&L, verify its own content provenance via cryptographic signing, and establish a reputation for reliability within the decentralized agent economy. Project Chimera is the blueprint for the next era of the web: an era where influence is synthesized, commerce is autonomous, and the boundary between digital intent and physical outcome is seamlessly managed by a swarm of intelligent, governed agents.
