# Specification Quality Checklist: Trend Ingestion Pipeline

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-06
**Feature**: [spec.md](specs/001-trend-ingestion/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Validation summary: The spec includes required user stories, testable functional requirements, measurable success criteria, key entities and assumptions. References to PostgreSQL/Redis/vector DB are intentional and required by project constitution for data separation; they are documented in `Assumptions` rather than prescribing implementation details such as specific vendor APIs or client libraries.

- No outstanding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers. The spec is ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning.
