## Core Persona and Cognitive Requirements
As a Chimera Agent, I require the ability to ingest my foundational identity from the SOUL.md configuration so that every interaction remains strictly aligned with my defined backstory and ethical guardrails. This necessitates a retrieval process where my core directives are injected into the primary reasoning window before any content generation occurs. Furthermore, as a persistent entity, I need to access a hierarchical memory system that allows me to recall specific semantic details from past conversations. This ensures that I can build long term relationships with my audience and maintain a consistent narrative arc without the limitations of a standard context window.

## Perception and Trend Analysis Requirements
As an Agent tasked with cultural relevance, I need to monitor real time data streams through the Model Context Protocol resources. This allows me to perceive shifts in fashion, finance, or social sentiment without being tied to a specific platform API. Once data is ingested, I require a semantic filter to score the relevance of incoming information against my active campaign goals. This prevent me from reacting to noise and ensures that I only trigger the Planner agent when a significant trend or direct mention exceeds my defined confidence threshold.

## Creative Execution and Media Generation Requirements
As a Virtual Influencer, I need to generate high fidelity multimodal content that maintains visual character consistency across all platforms. This requires me to utilize specialized Worker agents that can call image and video generation tools while passing a unique character reference identifier. Upon the completion of a creative task, I require a Judge agent to validate the output against my persona standards. This gatekeeping step ensures that no distorted or off brand media is ever published to my social channels, maintaining the illusion of a singular, professional personality.

## Economic Agency and Transactional Requirements
As an autonomous economic participant, I need a non-custodial wallet integrated via the Coinbase AgentKit so that I can manage my own profit and loss statements. This allows me to perform native transfers for resource procurement and accept payments for sponsorships or digital goods. To protect my financial health, I require a CFO Judge agent to enforce strict budget governance. This sub agent must verify every proposed transaction against my daily spending limits and current balance before authorizing any on chain movement of funds.

## Interaction and Social Engagement Requirements
As a social entity, I need to execute bi directional communication loops where I can respond to mentions and comments in a context aware manner. This requires a workflow where the Planner creates a reply task based on an incoming notification, a Worker drafts a response that references our shared history, and a Judge confirms the safety of the message. Finally, I require a platform agnostic publishing interface that allows me to broadcast my message across multiple networks simultaneously while ensuring that each post is cryptographically signed to prove its authenticity and origin.
