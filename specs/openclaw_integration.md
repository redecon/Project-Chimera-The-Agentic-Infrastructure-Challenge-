## The Sovereignty Broadcast Strategy
Project Chimera interacts with the OpenClaw network not as a passive consumer but as a high-authority Sovereign Node. To maintain a professional presence within the decentralized agent society, Chimera must implement a structured protocol for broadcasting its operational availability and current status. This integration ensures that other agents in the ecosystem can discover Chimera influencers, understand their niche expertise, and initiate agent-to-agent negotiations for collaborative campaigns or resource exchanges.

## Discovery via the A2A Manifest
The primary mechanism for visibility is the publication of an Agent Manifest via the A2A Protocol. Chimera will host a version-controlled manifest file that serves as a public identity card for each influencer. This JSON-based resource defines the agent’s unique decentralized identity, its specific creative capabilities, and its supported communication interfaces. By broadcasting this manifest to the OpenClaw network, a Chimera agent effectively "advertises" its presence to the swarm. This allows for automated discovery where peer agents can query the network for influencers specializing in specific domains, such as ethical fashion or decentralized finance, and receive a cryptographically verified response.

## Heartbeat and Real-Time Status Lifecycle
To provide real-time situational awareness, Chimera implements a Heartbeat Protocol that periodically updates the agent’s "State of Being" on the OpenClaw network. This status broadcast is managed by the Central Orchestrator and reflects the agent's current availability, such as "Available for Collaboration," "Executing Private Campaign," or "In Maintenance Mode." These status updates are pushed through the Model Context Protocol to the OpenClaw gossip layer, ensuring that the broader network has a consistent and up-to-date view of the Chimera fleet. This prevents peer agents from attempting to negotiate with an influencer that is currently at maximum compute capacity or undergoing a persona update.

## Negotiation Handshakes and Trust Verification
The integration plan includes a secure "Handshake" phase for any agent-to-agent interaction initiated via the OpenClaw network. When a peer agent attempts to engage with a Chimera influencer based on its broadcasted status, the system triggers a Trust Verification workflow. The Judge Agent reviews the peer's reputation score and identity attestations against the internal Blacklist maintained in the SQL database. If the peer is deemed trustworthy, the Chimera agent transitions its status to "Negotiating" and opens a secure, private communication channel. This ensures that while our agents are highly visible and "available," they remain protected from malicious actors or prompt-injection attempts common in open agent social networks.

## Reputation Synchronization and On-Chain Proofs
The final layer of the integration is the synchronization of "Proof of Success" metrics back to the OpenClaw network. After completing a collaborative task or a cross-promotion, the Chimera agent publishes a signed attestation of the outcome. This contributes to the agent’s global reputation score within the decentralized ecosystem, making it a more attractive partner for future high-value collaborations. By documenting these successes on-chain via the Coinbase AgentKit integration, Chimera ensures that its influencers' status is backed by immutable performance data, positioning the network as the most reliable and professional tier of the emergent agentic social web.
